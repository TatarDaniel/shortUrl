# ShortURL - URL Shortening Service

## Project Description

**ShortURL** is a URL shortening service that allows users to transform long, unwieldy URLs into compact, easy-to-share links. This service is designed to provide a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for managing and sharing URLs.

This project is built with modern Java technologies, leveraging **Spring Boot** for backend services, **Vaadin** for the user interface, and a combination of **PostgreSQL** and a **NoSQL database** for data storage. It is containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment and management across different environments.

## Tech Stack

- **Java 17**: The latest long-term support (LTS) version of Java, offering modern language features and performance improvements.
- **Spring Boot 3.2**: A powerful framework for building web applications in Java, providing a wide range of features and integrations.
- **Vaadin**: A framework for building modern web applications in Java, enabling you to create a responsive user interface without requiring frontend skills.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust, open-source relational database system used to store user data and analytics.
- **NoSQL Database**: (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) Used for caching and storing non-relational data such as user session information, URL metadata, etc.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used for managing dependencies and project builds.
- **Docker**: Containerization technology to package the application, along with all dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.
